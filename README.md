# Blockchain learning and introduction to Le-Coin

I'm using [`poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) to handle environment and dependencies.

Install poetry: `curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/get-poetry.py | python`

Install dependencies: `poetry install`

Activate venv: `poetry shell`

- Or run directly without venv: `poetry run`
